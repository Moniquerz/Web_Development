# ACC Software Bootcamp - Assesment #1

</center>

## INSTRUCTIONS:

1.  Git clone this `Students_Jan_2022_Reviews` repository to your computer, within your "Bootcamp" folder. 
    - You can run the command `ls -a` to ensure you are not currently in a repository (you would see a `.git` folder). You should not clone a repository within a repository since that will cause issues pushing your work up. Find a more appropriate place to clone if that is the case.

2.  Copy the `01_assessment` folder over to your ACCSoftwareBootcamp repo, so you can edit the contents there and commit/push them for grading.

    For example, get the questions from

    `github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/Students_Jan_2022_Reviews/01_assessment`

    And push your answers to

    `github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/<YOUR_REPO>/01_assessment`

3.  There's a folder for each question. Please write your answers within the respective folder's `question.md` file. You are welcome to create more files and folders to support or confirm your answers.

4.  This review is in 2 parts

    1. **Section 1: Multiple choice questions**. 40% of the credit. Please choose one best answer from the provided Google Form.

    2. **Section 2: Small questions**. 60% of the credit.

5.  This review is open book. You may use all references available to you to answer the questions. You may ask instructors/mentors to point you in the right direction, if you are stuck. Think of this as a typical work environment, where you may ask a mentor to show you the way, but not do the work for you. Do not ask another student.

6.  If a code snippet on the review has a bug, please feel free to fix it and then answer.

7.  To make sure you have enough time for all short questions, return to the difficult ones later. They are not numbered in any particular order.

8.  Please `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` your answers to your private ACCSoftwareBootcamp repository only. Do so as often as you wish, to make sure your answers are backed-up to github.com.

## TIME AVAILABLE

1. You will have from 9am to 5pm to complete the exam. Only the last commit before 5pm will be considered for grading.

2. Many students are able to complete the exam within the 4 hours during the class hours that meets on Saturdays. That said, take your time, pace yourself and do try taking short breaks.

## INTEGRITY:

Remember this review is a test of how well prepared you are. You need an honest answer. Try to satisfy the spirit of the review. While some of the questions may appear difficult, they CAN be answered with some amount of research and thinking. It is more important to learn from this experience, than to bypass it. As such, here are some ground rules

- No sharing of direct or indirect answers, between students.
- Absolutely no sharing of answer code.
- Absolutely no sharing of screens.
- No sharing of url references, your peers can web search too ;-).
- Any clarification from instructors should be posted on Slack under the channel **#assessments** such that all students have access to the same clarification.

## EVALUATION

1. 70% of overall score is needed for being considered as successful. However, remember that pass/not passed is calculated on the overall grade, not on the midterm.

2. Credit is given for partially complete or partly correct answers as well. Hence do not skip questions, unless indicated.
