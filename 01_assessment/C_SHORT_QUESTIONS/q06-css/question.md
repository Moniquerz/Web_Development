### Question 06:

### Question A:
My paragraph tags in the index.html file are supposed to have a background color of aqua blue but instead I am getting white backgrounds. Please fix this and explain why the background colors were white instead (what CSS rule took place?). No more than a sentence needed for the explanation.

### Answer A:
Equal specificity. p was was selected to have a white background, then selected again to have the color aqua. The last one specified "wins".



### Question B: 
"Paragraph 2" is supposed to have a bold text but for some reason it is not. Please fix this and comment below what was happening that stopped the bold font from happening.

### Answer B:
Paragraph 2 had id="unique" that was selcted to have normal font weight. id is more specific than class.
