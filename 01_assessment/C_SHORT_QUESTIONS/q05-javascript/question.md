### Question 05:

Create a function called "oddEven" that will take two numbers as arguments. This function should return an object where the keys are the numbers between the first argument and the second argument (inclusive). The values of the object will be a string that says "odd" or "even" depending on the key. The arguements will be integers bigger than zero.

### Example 1

      oddEven(1,5)

would return:

      {
      1: "odd",
      2: "even",
      3: "odd",
      4: "even",
      5: "odd"
      }

### Example 2

      oddEven(5,9)

would return:

      {
      5: "odd",
      6: "even",
      7: "odd",
      8: "even",
      9: "odd
      }
