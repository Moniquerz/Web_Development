### Question 02:

In the index.html file within this folder is a bootstrap boilerplate with this code included:

```
    <div class="row">
        <div class="">Ruby Red</div>
        <div class="">Navy Blue</div>
        <div class="">Lime Green</div>
        <div class="">Egg Nog</div>
    </div>
```

Using only Bootstrap make it so that on medium and larger screen these elements all appear on one row. On smaller screens they should stack to create one column

### Your answer will be in the index.html file
