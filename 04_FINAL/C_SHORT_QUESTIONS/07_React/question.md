Create a react component that renders a login form with userid and password.
Provide a checkbox or icon with a label next to it that says "view password".
When they click that icon/checkbox, the password field should show the password
typed in that field.

Hint: 

1. you may use a state variable that is used to display or hide the password.

1. this may be accomplished using libraries. However, we are looking for your
ability to code this feature in plain ReactJS, using state.

1. Take it as far as you can, and time permitting make it as user friendly as possible, using the techniques you already know.
