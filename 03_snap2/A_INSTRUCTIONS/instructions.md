### INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Git clone this `Students_Jan_2022_Reviews` folder to your computer. If you already have it from a previous assessment, then `git pull` within this repository's folder to update your local repository.

2. Copy this `03_snap2` folder over to your personal repository within github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp, so you may edit the contents there and commit/push them for grading.

   For example, get the questions from

   `github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/Students_Jan_2022_Reviews/03_snap2`

   And push your answers to

   `github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/YOUR_GITHUB_HANDLE/03_snap2`

3. There's a folder for each question. You can create additional files within the folder if it helps you arrive at an answer and demonstrate your solution.

4. This review is in 2 parts:

   1. **Multiple choice questions (60%)**. These questions have equal weight. Go to the provided Google Docs link.

   2. **Practical (40%)**. Do not skip the practical in order to stay above passing level. Partial work will receive some credit. You only need to answer ONE of the practical questions.

5. This review is open book. You may use suitable references available to you to answer the questions.

6. If a code snippet on the review has a bug, please fix it and then answer.

Some ground rules you are expected to follow:

1. No sharing of direct or indirect answers.
2. Absolutely no sharing of answer code.
3. No sharing of url references, your peers can web search too.
