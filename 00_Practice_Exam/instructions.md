# INSTRUCTIONS
This is a practice exam to prepare you for taking a real ACC Software Bootcamp exam. One of the most important instructions you will see in the `instructions.md` file will be this:

1.  Git clone this `Students_<YOUR COHORT>_Reviews` repository to your computer, within the `Bootcamp` folder or a folder that is NOT inside your repo.

2.  Copy the `01_Assessment` folder over to your ACCSoftwareBootcamp repo, so you can edit the contents there and commit/push them for grading.

    For example, get the questions from

    `github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/Students_Aug_2021_Reviews/01_Assessment`

    And push your answers to

    `github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/<YOUR_REPO>/01_Assessment`

The next step will be answering the questions. In this practice exam there is only one question `Q1_Practice_Question`. After answering this question you may move on to the final step: commit and push this exam to your student repo!

```
git add .
git commit -m "answered Q1"
git push
```
