<!--Task 1-->
    <!-- <h1 id="dog" class="cat">Hello World</h1> -->
    <!-- 6. red border with black background and white words -->

<!--Task 2-->
    <!-- <h1 id="mouse" class="cat">Hola Mundo</h1> -->
    <!-- 3. you cant see the words because this id does not have a color. the defult color for the content is black and the background is also black because of class cat  -->

<!--Task 3-->
    <!-- <h1 id="bird" class="cat">Bonjour monde!</h1> -->
    <!-- 3. red border with black background. the red border is from the h1 selector.  black background is from class.cant see the words because this id does not have color. default colo for content is black. -->

<!--Task 4. 
    the first and last h1 resized. the second h1 did not because pixels is an absolute unit, will always be the same size. % is relative to the parent element. and vw is relative to the viewports width-->
    
<!--Task 6-->
    <!-- <h1 id="horse" class="cat">Ciao mondo!</h1> -->

<!--Task 8-->
<!-- <div>
    <img src="assets/computer-code.jpg">
</div> -->
<!-- 3. the image took up the entire screen -->
<!-- tried to center using margin auto but it did not move -->
<!--added border and it extended all the way to the right side of the screen -->
<!-- added width of 25% and it made the image smaller -->
<!-- changed the width of image to 100% and it now fills up the space in the border -->
<!-- the image tag is in inline element and the width is releative to the parent div which is a block element. -->

    <!-- <p id="p1" class="changeFont">Paragraph 1</p>
    <p id="p2"class="changeFont" >Paragraph 2</p>
    <p id="p3" class="changeFont">Paragraph 3</p>
    <p id="p4" class="changeFont">Paragraph 4</p> -->
<!--other elements did not change color because I selected the id p3 and id is more specific than a tag selector.-->
<!-- tried to used p to change color to green but it did not change because .changeFont class is more specific than tag -->
<!-- third element did not change color because its id has a color attribute. id is more specfic than the tag and class selector. -->
